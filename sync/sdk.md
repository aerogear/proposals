# Sync SDK

## Platforms

The initial targeted platforms for a Sync SDK are:

* Android
* iOS
* Cordova

Progressive Web App (PWA) may be targetted at a later stage.

## MemeoList App for 'dogfooding'

During development of the Data Sync Server and the Client SDKs, it will be helpful to have Apps with real functionality and use cases.
2 Apps were considered for this:

* Memeolist App (more info at https://github.com/aerogear/proposals/pull/41)
* Cool Stuff Store App

At this time, only the Memeolist App will be used for this 'dogfooding' purpose. However, it may make sense to convert/write other Apps to work with Data Sync. 

## Binary upload

Binary upload in the context of GraphQL means supporting the upload of binary content to a Mutation.
It also covers the retrieval of binary content from the GraphQL API, and back to the App.
